## Overview

This is a take-home test for candidates applying for a full-stack developer
position . It contains three sections: "Frontend" and "Backend" which
together include a series of tests involving React, Typescript, and Node.js.


## Backend

1. Features:
- API Endpoints to perform CRUD operations:
- POST /tasks: Add a new task.
- GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.
- PUT /tasks/:id: Update a task by ID.
- DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by ID.
2. Implementation Requirements:
- Use Express.js to create RESTful routes.
- Store tasks in an array (or MongoDB if applicable).
- Ensure proper error handling and status codes in API responses.
- Use CORS middleware to allow frontend-backend communication.
Task Instructions:
1. Project Setup:
- Create two folders: one for the React frontend and one for the Node.js
backend.
- Use Create React App or Vite for the frontend.
- Use Express.js for the backend.
2. Expected Deliverables:
- A fully functional Todo List with both frontend and backend connected.
- Simple README.md explaining the project structure and steps to run the
app.
- (Optional) Include a GitHub repository with the project.

## Technologies

Frontend: `React`, `React-Dom`, `mui/material`, `Typescript`

## Install
- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm install`

## Run
- Run `npm run dev` to see the app running locally

## Future Works

- Implement pagination and sort in backend.
